# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Analysis
The data presented in this dashboard comes from The Public Science Lab at North Carolina State University. It explores samples of bacteria taken from belly buttons.
